@center(FREEMAN LINDER RECEIVES AWARD)

Freeman Linder, president and chairman of Pacific Trade Associates
Inc., received an award as "Goodwill Ambassador of the Year" from the
Valley Asian-American Friendship Club at its dinner meeting
Thursday night.  Mr@. Linder was honored "for his long and
energetic service in the cause of peace and friendship between
the peoples of Asia and America."

In receiving the award Mr@. Linder gave a talk about his career
and the changes he has seen in Asian-American relations.  After
quitting an engineering major in college to serve in the Marines in 1898,
he was
stationed in Shanghai during the "Boxer Rebellion" of 1900.
When his term of service ended, he remained in Asia, travelling in China and
Japan, and supporting himself as a free-lance engineering consultant,
much like former President Hoover.

In 1910 he returned to the States, married, and tried to settle
down in a job with an engineering company.  However, he found his
opportunities for advancement limited by the lack of a formal degree,
so he signed on as a civilian engineer for the Japanese military
during the World War.

After the Armistice, he
founded Pacific Trade Associates, an
export-import agency with its first offices in Tokyo and Los
Angeles.  His business grew rapidly with the general increase in
trans-Pacific trade, and eventually it opened additional offices
in Hong Kong and Singapore.  He acquired a cosmopolitan
knowledge of Asian cultures through his business contacts, and
his talk included amusing anecdotes of culture shock on the part
of both himself and others.

As the story begins, you find a matchbook on the curb.
G/R will create a custom matchbook with the name of a restaurant, like
'The Brass Lantern'. The matches may be all gone, but there will be a
phone number written on the inside flap, like Chandler 1729.

@heading(Mrs Linder's Suicide Note:)

Dear Monica,

By the time you find this note, you will know that I can't bear
to live any more, with or without your father. If he had paid either more
attention to me as a person, or less attention to me as a woman,
I think none of this trouble would have come to us.
You can't blame Ralph -- if he hadn't come along, someone else would.
You have been such a comfort to me,
but even you couldn't make up for my rotten marriage. If only I hadn't felt like a widow
for so long. . . But there are already too many "ifs" in my story.
There will be no "if" about the end of it, thanks to the hardware
your father got for my "protection". This is the end of the battles and
the bitterness. This should be a new beginning for you.

-- Mother.
