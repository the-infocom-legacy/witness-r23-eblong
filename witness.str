Grounds of Linder House
You are in the front yard of the Linder property. Most of the space is
occupied by a kitchen garden full of vegetables and herbs. A wooden
fence surrounds the yard on the west and north sides. To the east is the
house, with a French door and two windows. To the south is a gate that
leads to the front porch.

driveway entrance
You are standing at the foot of the driveway, the entrance to the
Linder property. The entire lot is screened from the street and the
neighbors by a wooden fence, except on the east
side, which fronts on dense bamboo woods. The house looks like a mixture of
a California bungalow and East Asian influences. From here you can
see the driveway leading north and, beyond that, the front door.
This is the entrance to the driveway from the street, which lies to the
south. To the north is the driveway, and to the east is the side yard.

The two sets of foot prints don't seem to match up.
Sgt. Duffy appears with his kit for casting with plaster of Paris.
He quickly makes a cast of the foot prints and hands it to you,
saying "I hope you find this as useful as it is heavy."

This is a rock garden in the Japanese style, east of Linder's bedroom.
A few smooth round boulders lie partly buried in a bed of gravel,
which is carefully raked to be reminiscent of flowing water.
A sequence of smaller rocks forms a zig-zag path from the bedroom door to
the south edge of the garden, where the lawn begins.

Inside the house
Monica's bedroom
On one side is a modern-style bed, with piles of well-thumbed detective
stories stacked on the table beside it. Opposite the bed is a long
dressing table that seems to serve also as desk and workbench. In the
corner sits a small table for a portable phonograph and records, and a
book case with more books and pulps. Movie posters cover the walls. A
handsome door with cedar veneer leads north, and a door and window face
outside.

Among make-up, letters, and tools, you find a medical report.
This table is pretty messy. Anyone but Monica would have a tough time
finding anything on it.

bedroom door
This room has only a large cabinet with counter, sink and mirror.
On the counter are a shaver, toothpaste, and so on.
The tub and toilet must be in separate rooms.
There are doors on all four walls: the one to the north looks like redwood,
the one to the south like cedar, and the other two like ordinary doors.
On the counter are a shaver, tooth paste, and so on.
This is a separate room, completely lined with tile, for bathing in the
Japanese style. On one side is a shower head and drain, where you could
wash away surface dirt. On the other side is a deep tub, to be filled
with steaming water up to your neck. Potted plants give the room a
tropical air. A window looks over the rock garden outside, and a door
leads west.

Anyone can see that you really need a shower. In fact, this is

awful wet, and you must have better things to do.

Linder's bedroom
The bedroom is elegant but not tidy. A four-poster bed, chair and
dresser, made of teak and mahogany, look hand-crafted. There are doors
on the west and south walls, and a door and window to the east look
outside. Clothes and newspapers are scattered about. It seems that

living room
A huge fieldstone fireplace on the south wall holds a blazing fire,
filling the living room with warmth and light. Grouped in front of the
fire are a glass-topped coffee table and a rattan davenport and club
chair, with cushions covered in a print showing bamboo plants in the
style of Japanese brush-painting. A lamp with a printed shade and a
telephone sit on the table.
On the north wall are a liquor cabinet and a console radio made of
light-colored wood.

to the south is a door. Other doors on both sides lead to other rooms.
office door
Linder says with frustration, "I wish you wouldn't try to go off while
we're trying to talk."
This is obviously the office of Mr. Linder's company, Pacific Trade
Associates. 
Behind it is a large ornately-carved chair, like a cruiser escorting a
battle ship
, where Linder sits imperiously
. A simple wooden chair, polished smooth by visitors,
flanks the desk on the other side. On the north wall is a lounge,
upholstered in green velvet and a bit lumpy, with a framed wood-block
picture hanging over it. On the outside wall, next to a door and window,
stands a grandfather clock, ticking relentlessly. A file cabinet stands
in the corner.
The door to the interior hallway is open.
The door leading outside is open.
The window facing the back yard is open.
At the west end of the office, a massive desk of teak and mahogany
faces toward the window. It has no drawers, but the top is covered with
piles of letters, some newspapers, a telephone, and various souvenirs
from the Far East.

police intelligence squad were seized in connection with an attempt to
assassinate private detective Harry Raymond; "Two Officers Die in Battle
With Maniac"; "Slayer of Tijuana Girl Executed under Fugitive Law"; and
"Austria Near Hitler Yoke."

The chair looks like teak, covered with carvings of vines and slithery
creatures that you wouldn't like to meet in a jungle.

This room is a well-equipped workshop. Besides the usual sort of tools,
the place is full of mechanical and electrical parts and supplies:
switches, relays, spools of colored wire, and so on. One wall holds the
main electric board and a home-made junction box with more wires going
in and out than you can shake a stick at. The only door is the one you
came in.
It looks just like ordinary wire.
You can find wire here in almost any color you like.

Knocking on the walls reveals nothing unusual.

 minutes, and it might not reveal much. Would you like to do it anyway?)
Your cursory search revealed nothing new.

 You can also see some relays and things.

Linder grabs your wrist and looks you hard in the eye. Then a wide smile breaks out on his face as he lets go. "Sorry if I'm rough, but I don't want any interruptions right now."
The garage, like a car port, has no door to keep the cars in. Doors lead north and east. The walls are decorated with spare tires and things. 
The red MG is gone.
Oil spots on the floor show that a car is often parked here.

Phong's straight black hair and folded eyelids make him obviously
Asian, but no definite nationality. His open, almost gentle face holds a
quick smile and eyes that seem to miss nothing. He carries his stout
body lightly, but you can see great strength under his light shirt and
dark trousers. You guess his age at about fifty, but who knows how many
lifetimes of experience he carries?

Linder stands at least six foot, with a powerful frame but quick actions,
like a cat. His eyeglasses sit on top of his head, where thin strands
of long black hair go here and there, mostly combed backward. His
wide-set hazel eyes size you up quickly from within their pouches in his
ruddy face. He wears a silk peach-colored Mandarin shirt and chocolate
trousers, impeccably tailored and laundered, but sweat gleams on his
high forehead, and he looks as though he hasn't slept much lately.

"I can't help you there."
"That has nothing to do with why I asked you here."
The young man looks you straight in the eye but says nothing. He looks like a
gigolo trying to imitate a university professor. His blond wavy hair
almost sparkles, like Pacific surf at night, but his recent panic has
left it dangling to one side. His hot blue eyes reveal his curiosity and
uncertainty about you.
"I couldn't help you if I wanted to."
"That has nothing to do with me."

Phong is here, 
"No, I must be careful about that."
"You'll have to ask Mr. Linder about that."
"I don't have the key for the clock."
"What are you talking about?" He looks frightened.
"It's true I helped set you up for deception with the guns. But only because Mr. Linder asked me to! He said he wanted to frighten Stiles. He wasn't supposed to be killed! Monica must have muffed it. Or else ... could she ...?" He looks confused and angry.
"I don't see why you're accusing me!
 Sure, I was in the yard, because 
I thought I heard a noise outside and went out to investigate.
 It's part of my job, you know."
"I don't see why you're accusing me!
 You should ask Monica about those guns."
"You haven't a clue, and you know it!"
"That's my butler's button, of course."
"I didn't think you had any interest in gardening! Those little babies are the best thing for the clay soil around here. You can just order them by mail and open them up when they arrive."
"I don't have one, if that's what you mean."
"Oh, Monica wired the house for butler's buttons."
"Oh, Monica wired the windows with burglar alarms."
"There's wire all over the house. You'll have to ask Monica."
"I have the keys for all the doors in the house."
"Don't you remember? I gave you all the keys I have."
"That looks like the key to Mr. Linder's clock."
"There's only one key to Mr. Linder's clock. I think he keeps it in the office somewhere."
"That man is a marvel. Always seems to have several deals going at once. I don't know how he does it." Linder beams with self-pride.
"Frankly, Detective, I can't say I
'm sorry he's dead

have managed
 the Asian branch of his business if he'd let me. If I had any money, I'd quit on the spot and return home."

 the Asian branch of his business if he'd let me. If I had any money, I'd quit on the spot and return home."
"She's an intelligent girl. Mr. Linder is very proud of her, but I think she acts too much like a man.
 She really muffed it this time.
"If only Mr. Linder had been home more, he could have kept her in line."
"Mr. Linder brought me here from Asia, to help manage his business and run his house. I guess I do more running than managing. If I can help you, just push the button anywhere in the house."
"I was in the kitchen and heard a sound like a gunshot, so I ran to the office and found you and Mr. Linder. You were closer to it than I was."
"He used to come around here now and then, when Mr. Linder was away. I never thought much about it until the fighting between Mr. and Mrs. got bad, just before Mrs. Linder passed on." He pauses. "I think Mr. Linder has been calling him on the telephone a lot lately."
"Everyone was sad about that. Mr. Linder just threw himself into his work, as usual. Monica was terribly depressed, didn't even come out of her room for a long time. I doubt she'll ever get over it."
"Mr. Linder probably kept it in his bank safe. I've never seen it."
"You'll have to ask Mr. Linder about that."
"What can I tell you? That's a 'flathead broom,' invented by your American Shakers, I believe."
He seems surprised. "Uh, that was just some door-to-door salesman."
"Yes, I think Monica bought those, using some other name."
"I've heard Mr. Linder mention that restaurant.
 But I don't recognize the phone number."
"I've heard Mr. Linder mention that restaurant.
Phong looks surprised but not alarmed. "This is the first I've heard of this."
"Those are my gardening boots. They're muddy because, while you were in the office, 
I thought I heard a noise outside and went out to investigate.
"I might as well tell you: Mr. Linder concocted this scheme to frighten Stiles, and he got Monica and me to help him. But he was supposed to be only wounded, not killed!"
Phong seems shaken, but all he says is, 
"That's my butler's button, of course."
"Mr. Linder has a certain fondness for elaborate things like that."
"If it's dust you're after, I plead guilty to plenty of it."
"Oh, I guess that's part of the burglar alarm."
"It's a mystery called 'Deadline.' Monica recommended it to me."
"Yes, that's the telegram Mr. Linder sent this morning."
"Yes, now you know that Mr. Linder forged that note. Stiles didn't send it to him."
"Yes, that's the note that Stiles sent to Mr. Linder."

"That's Monica's territory. I don't interfere."
"What phone call? I haven't talked with Stiles since my wife's death. I'm really afraid he wants to do me in."
"Phong keeps the house keys for me."
"You've probably read about me in the papers. In fact they just published something about me when I won that award. And I've heard lots about you. That's why I asked you here."
"It's still too painful for me to talk about, I'm afraid."
"Money?! I asked you here to prevent a crime. I hope you're not thinking of some outlandish fee!"
"She's a loyal and intelligent girl. I'm very proud of her."
"He and I go back a long time. Met in Asia, you know. And since I spend as much time there as here, he takes care of the house for me. A fine fellow, and I trust him implicitly."
"All I know about Stiles is that he's a writer of some kind, and sometimes he plays bit parts in films. I've never really met the man."
"I'll explain all that shortly, after I finish this drink."
"My friend Klutz, the Police Chief, recommended you to me."
"That has nothing to do with why I asked you here."
"Oh, Phong must have left it there after cleaning up."
"I found that in an obscure but wealthy estate in Asia during the war and brought it home as booty. Sitting in it makes me feel like an 'Oriental Potentate.'"
"She's Monica's cat. You'd do better to ask her."
"I've always admired elaborate machines, and that's the finest example I could hope to own."
"I didn't ask you here so you could search the house!"
"I think Phong goes there sometimes. I've never been there myself." He almost flinched before answering, but now he's as smooth as ever.
"I already told you that I haven't seen it before."
Linder looks surprised and a bit alarmed. "This is the first I've heard of this. I don't know why my doctor didn't tell me about it."
"That's the butler's button, of course."
"I wish you wouldn't meddle in my files while we're trying to talk."
"Oh, uh, that's part of the burglar alarm."
"Yes, that's the telegram I sent this morning."

 said he wanted to pay me a bundle to leave town."
"Is that your man? When I came running out of the woods, he grabbed me as if I was some kind of criminal. He wouldn't let me go! So here I am."
"Don't ask me. I never touch them."
"What about them? They're muddy because I had to run through the yard and woods to get away from the shooting."
"I don't get it. I think he's more dangerous than I am!"
"Yeah, Linder
 said he wanted to pay me a bundle to leave town."
"She's probably just another dizzy dame, but I don't really know her well enough to say."
"Virginia was a special woman. Repressed for years. I think that, if only ... Say, I don't have to answer your questions!"

"There's not much to tell. I'm a writer, but that doesn't take you far these days. So I do some film work on the side. Some day my agent will wise up and find me a decent publisher."
"I've never seen it before. Anyhow, I don't like guns."
"That's my phone number! Linder must have jotted it down the day we had lunch at that restaurant,
 when he first offered me money to leave town."
"I think that's the name of the restaurant where Linder took me to lunch,
 when he first offered me money to leave town."
"So the old man was on the way out, eh? Wish I'd known that." He pauses. "I mean, I could have taken his money and blown town until he kicked the bucket, then come back. Too late now."

"Why should I?"
"What murder? What are you talking about?" Her cheeks quiver like jelly.
"You were there when it happened. Isn't it obvious that Stiles did it?"
"It's true I helped set up the gun mechanism. But Dad was already dying! You can find the medical report on the desk 
in my room. He was ... dying ..." She breaks down in tears.
"I've told you already: he was dying!" Tears dribble down her cheeks.
"I don't understand! I believed that medical report, and I don't know why the doctor lied to me about the tumor. You think I wanted to murder my own father? I thought he was dying already!" Her eyes are pleading with you now, begging you to believe her.
"That has nothing to do with why Dad asked you here."
"That's the butler's button, you cheesehead."
"I have nothing to say to you about that."
"That bell system is just one of the features I've put in this house. Beyond your imagination, probably."
"That alarm system is another of the features I've put in this house. You probably know the kind of low-life that would try to break in here."

She rambles a bit, as if dreaming. "To be honest, I feel relieved ... that he's met his Maker. Now I won't feel as if I'm under his thumb when he's home. He really treated all of us like ... his property, even Mother. I guess I'm an orphan now, but ... "
"Oh, I can tell you lots about him. Do you want to know if he was a good husband? A good father? Anything but a selfish ..."
"That's between Mother and me."
"She was the most noble woman I've ever known. Did her best to be a 'good wife' even though she was alone so much. No one understood her as I did, certainly not Father. Sometimes I feel I could just ..." She slams a clenched fist into her palm.

"I don't know anything about you, but I 
had hoped you could
hope you can

"I don't want to talk about it."
"Terry's a good friend of mine, that's all."
"Dad kept it in his bank safe. I'll bet Phong would like to see it."
"You'll have to ask Dad about that."
"That has nothing to do with why Dad asked you here."
"She's my cat. I named her Asta, because she's at least as smart as the dog in 'The Thin Man.'"
"I don't know where Dad keeps it."
"That's the only key for the clock. So what?"
"What about it? It's no crime to get a little heat for self-protection."

"I already told you: Dad's about to kick the bucket."
"How did you find that? Dad gave it to me so I could try to understand what's wrong and what his chances are. They don't look good." She looks alarmed.
"Oh, uh, that's part of a timed lock I set up for the office."
"You seem to have discovered Dad's little plot to frighten Stiles. Sure, I helped set it up for him. But I don't know what went wrong. He wasn't supposed to die!" Her lower lip is quivering.
"That's the butler's button, you cheesehead."
"Phong really ought to do a better job of cleaning around here."
"That gat you found? Phong planted it so it would look as if Stiles used it."
"That gat you found? It must belong to Stiles."
"I've never seen it before. It looks as if you don't take good care of it."
"It's a swell mystery called 'Deadline.' I haven't figured it out yet."
"That must be the telegram Dad sent this morning."
"That looks like my ticket stub. I didn't know I dropped it."
"It was called 'Dead End'. I don't think this Bogart guy is pretty enough to make it big."
"I think we'll see 'Dead End'. Terry wants to check out this guy named Bogart."

Come off it, Detective. We've worked together before. You sure you didn't stop at a bar tonight?
Ah, that's where the late Mrs. Linder did herself in. A messy business, Detective.

Here is the code for goal motivation for the various characters.
Each character has a tendency to move from one place to another
at certain times. They all converge on the living room at about
noon.
Goal tables for the 6 characters (including PLAYER), offset
by the preceding constants, which, for a given character,
is the P?CHARACTER property of the object.
Offsets into GOAL-TABLEs
Goal-function constants, similar to M-xxx in MAIN
Here's how the movement goals are done:  For each player is
a table which consists of triplets, a number of minutes until
the next movement (an clock interrupt number), a number of
minutes allowed variation (for a bit of randomness), and a
room toward which to start. All movement is controlled by
the GOAL-ENABLE flag in the GOAL-TABLE for a character.
Time starts at 8AM. Characters are at that point in their
starting positions, as reflected in DUNGEON.
This routine does the interrupt-driven goal establishment
for the various characters, using the MOVEMENT-GOALS table.

February 28
on your fine detective work.|
on the fine teamwork between you and Sergeant Duffy.|
to you, but even more to Detective Duffy on his promotion.|
Somewhere near Los Angeles. A cold Friday evening in February 1938. In this climate, cold is anywhere below about fifty degrees. Storm clouds are swimming across the sky, their bottoms glowing faintly from the city lights in the distance. A search light pans slowly under the clouds, heralding another film premiere. The air seems expectant, waiting for the rain to begin, like a cat waiting for the ineffable moment to ambush.

The taxi has just dropped you off at the entrance to the Linders' driveway. The driver didn't seem to like venturing into this maze of twisty streets any more than you did. But the house windows are full of light, and radio music drifts toward you. Your favorite pistol, a snub-nosed Colt .32, is snug in its holster. You just picked up a match book off the curb. It might come in handy. Good thing you looked up the police file on Mrs. Linder's death. Her suicide note and the newspaper story told you all you know about the family. The long week is finished, except for this appointment. But why does an ominous feeling grip you?

Police Chief Klutz walks up to you, from out of nowhere. "I'm sorry, Detective, but you can't spend any more time here. We need you at the Coliseum for the all-day Police Department track-and-field meet. I hope you had a restful night!" He escorts you to a waiting police car, and you go off into the sunrise.

Suddenly, your assistant, Sgt. Duffy, appears from out of nowhere. "Hello, Detective!
 I thought I should come here on the streetcar, in case you needed help. 
I'll be nearby if you want me." He disappears just as quickly.
 "Detective, I'm glad you're safe!
 Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're hiding.
 I thought I should come here on the streetcar, in case you needed help. 
I'm familiar with the house, since I was here to help investigate Mrs. Linder's death. Just as I walked up tonight, I heard a shot! The next thing I knew, this man, who calls himself Stiles, burst out of the woods behind the house. Naturally, I put the nippers on him and brought him along.
Your assistant, Sgt. Duffy, sees you.
 I'll just stow him in the living room and stand by to help you."
Don't you remember? Duffy went in the ambulance to the Coroner's office. 
You'll have to wait for him to return.

No one answers the door, but a police car races in the driveway and stops. Two officers jump out, grab you roughly, and haul you off as a trespasser.
Someone turns off the radio. 
You hear footsteps inside the house. Then the door swings open.
The butler isn't smiling now. "I told you Mr. Linder will be in touch. Please leave before I call the police!" He slams the door in your face.
"Good evening," says a smiling face, "I am Phong. I'm sorry, but you're too late arriving here. Mr. Linder has other business now. But he thanks you for coming and says he'll be in touch. Good night!" He closes the door in your face.
"Good evening," says a smiling face, "I am Phong. Please come in." He leads you into the house and closes the door behind you.

 He leads you into a hallway and turns left. 
 He leads you north along the hallway. 
 As you get near the living room, you hear voices talking, half-loud and fast.
Linder turns to you and says, "Detective, am I glad to see you! 
I was afraid you'd met with an accident. I'm afraid I don't have time for you now, since I have another appointment. But thank you for coming. I'll be in touch. Phong, please show the Detective out."

 I'll be with you as soon as I finish my drink."
Phong grabs you by the arm and guides you to the front door. It's obvious that you have no choice. "Thank you for coming, Detective. Good night!" He closes the door in your face.
Linder follows you 
 He looks out the window and checks the lock.
The lights go on in Linder's office.
Linder gulps down the rest of his drink. "Well, Detective," he says, "I'm anxious to get on with our business. Let's you and I go to my office so we can talk undisturbed." 
He takes you by the arm, opens a door to the east and leads you through it.

Linder sits down in the carved chair.

Linder says, "I repeat: i
f you'll just take a chair, I'll explain what this is all about."
Linder begins his story. "My late wife, may she rest in peace, got involved with a young man named Stiles. Naturally I tried to stop this affair, but without much success. Since my wife passed away, this Stiles fellow has gone off the deep end, I'm afraid, and blamed me for her death. I tried my best to ignore him, but he seems to have lost his senses. This morning I received this note and decided to ask your help." He hands the note to you.
 Suddenly there is a flash of light and an explosion, and 
everything goes black. What a lousy way to step off, poking around like a two-bit shamus!
mortal pain radiates from your heart. As blood fills your lungs and a scream fills your brain, you feel sure of only one thing: you should have taken a chair when Linder asked you to.

Inscrutably, Phong turns to leave.

Suddenly Phong appears and

Suddenly Phong appears and 
says, "You rang?"
Monica says, "Yes, Phong, I was testing a new twist on the household wiring that I thought of during the film.
 Can't you talk this copper into letting me loose?" Phong opens his eyes wide for a moment but says nothing.
Suddenly Phong enters the office. "I believe you called for me, Detective."
Suddenly Phong enters the office. When he sees that Linder has cashed in his chips, he turns away for a minute and bows his head.
The butler comes up to you, looking agitated.
You hear the door bell ring.
Phong arrives and lets Sergeant Duffy in.
Suddenly Phong comes in, lies down, and starts reading a book.
Linder looks toward the window and says, "I don't think Phong has answered the door bell yet." He reaches toward the butler's button and at the same instant shouts "Stiles!" You turn around and dimly see a figure outside.
 The figure outside turns and runs before you can see the face. When you turn back around, you see Linder slumping down in his chair, with a bloody stain spreading across his silk shirt. He teeters on the edge of the seat, then falls onto the floor, quite dead.

A young woman
 bursts into the office, wearing a felt hat and wool coat, and struggling to get her driving gloves on. 
She glances icily in your direction and then back to her father. "I'm off to the pictures with Terry, Dad. Good-bye." She hugs him briefly but firmly, burying her head in his shoulder. He pushes her away and says, "You're leaving now?! I thought you'd be talking to the detective here. What about the threat on my life?" He has the hurt look of an orphan pup. She answers, "You don't need me here. I need to get away now and then. I'm not like Mother, you know." Tears well up in her eyes but she brushes them away before they drop. She turns to leave.
She glances quickly around the room, then turns to leave.

Monica rushes in. "Stand aside, flatfoot, I'm going to be sick." She leans over the toilet and gives in to an attack of dry heaves.
The door to the toilet room slams shut. You hear sounds of dry heaving inside.
Monica comes in, sits down on her bed, and buries her face in her hands. "Leave me alone for a while. I'm really not well." She begins to sob.
Monica slams shut her bedroom doors.
Monica comes into the office quietly and, seeing you, steps over to the desk and shuffles some papers. Then she sighs, rubs her eyes, and turns to leave without saying a word.
 quietly sticks her head in the door, looks quickly around the room, and then steps over to the desk. She pushes the butler's button and seems to listen for the bell. She takes another look around, then crosses the room to the clock. Looking well rehearsed, she produces a key, opens the door of the case, takes something out and puts it in the pocket of her slacks, and then shuts and locks the case.
You barely hear a bell ring in the distance.
The lights go out in the middle bedroom.
Monica comes in and sits down at her dressing table. Her eyes are red from crying. "Go peddle your cookies somewhere else. I'm going to have some Ovaltine and go to bed."
Monica slams shut her bedroom doors.
Monica looks more nervous. "I really must go now, or I'll be late for the film." She hugs her father again and dashes out the door.

 Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're hiding.
 See you later!"
 They head for the street.
Without warning, Duffy comes running up to you and says, "I just got back from the morgue. The coroner 
found no evidence of the alleged stomach tumor. In fact, he could find no organic disease that would either explain the death or support the theory that Linder wanted to die. He 
concluded that Linder died of a single small-caliber bullet through the heart. And here's something peculiar: there were no traceable rifle marks on the bullet.

Duffy appears, to escort you from the grounds.

 "Let's not have any trouble, now," says Duffy, in his unique way. They head for the driveway, where a police car waits with engine purring.

The elaborate set-up in Mr. Linder's office was ingenious. You deserve congratulations for your work in detecting it.

I am sorry to report that the trial jury acquitted Ralph Stiles of the murder of his rival, Freeman Linder. In view of the available evidence, they apparently believed that his lack of access to the Linder house made it doubtful that he could construct the hidden gun mechanism.
At the inquest, the coroner ruled that 
Mr. Linder's death was suicide, based on all the available evidence. However, my knowledge of Linder's personality makes me doubt that, knowing he would be killed, he would devise such an elaborate scheme to try to punish Mr. Stiles for the affair with Mrs. Linder. 
At the inquest, the coroner ruled that 
the available evidence was inconclusive, in that Linder appears to have had no motive for suicide. 
I think that, if you had been more careful in observing the people in Linder's household, you would have discovered that he had an accomplice, at least.

The web of evidence certainly seems to implicate both Monica Linder and Mr. Phong. During interrogation, Phong admitted helping Mr. Linder carry out the plan to frame Mr. Stiles for attempted murder, but he repeatedly denied that Linder's death was intended. He bargained with the District Attorney and entered a plea of guilty to charges of conspiracy and extortion. After a short trial, the judge gave him a suspended sentence and recommended him for deportation to his home country.

Monica turned out to be a tougher nut to crack. She refused to talk during interrogation, and she was awaiting trial when she heard about Phong's suspended sentence. She then made a plea like his, and the judge had little choice but to give her the same sentence. Instead of deportation, she will be on probation for five years.

I can't help thinking that everyone in the Linder household conspired in the original plan, but that Monica acted alone in turning the plan into murder. I suppose we'll never know the real truth now.
I am sorry to report that the trial jury acquitted Mr. Phong of the murder of his employer. Apparently they believed that 
the available evidence against him was circumstantial, since there was no definite link between him and the murder weapon. In addition, it seems that 
he lacks the mechanical skills necessary to construct the hidden gun mechanism.

While Monica could have conspired with him and aided him, she too was acquitted of conspiracy, because 
he was. If only we had tried her for plain murder instead of conspiracy!

the available evidence against her was circumstantial, since there was no definite link between her and the hidden gun mechanism.

I am glad to report that the trial jury, based on your testimony and her confession in court, convicted Monica Linder of the murder of her father in revenge for the death of her mother. Congratulations 
Which reminds me of another fascinating case I would like to assign you to...

Coming soon: Another INTERLOGIC Mystery from Infocom.

I am sorry to report that the trial jury acquitted Monica Linder of the murder of her father. Apparently they believed that 
the available evidence against her was circumstantial, since there was no definite link between her and the hidden gun mechanism.

I am sorry to report that the trial jury acquitted Monica Linder of the murder of her father, because 
she had no apparent motive.

According to your report and deposition and the available physical evidence, you seem to believe that Mr. Linder shot himself through the window of his office. If you continue to come up with such odd conclusions, I will be forced to transfer you to the traffic-control department.

According to your report and deposition, the only question in this case is who shot Mr. Linder through the window of his office. However, I believe that the real story is not so simple.

In fact, in view of the flimsy evidence available, the District Attorney has decided not to indict 
 in this case.
But, despite my reservations, the trial jury did convict Mr. Stiles of the murder. Through plea-bargaining, his sentence was reduced from execution to twenty years.
 In his opinion, Phong's foot prints outside are not incriminating, even though they were apparently made at the time of the shooting. After all, Phong's household duties could easily have taken him there for any number of reasons. In Phong's own deposition, he claimed to have heard noises outside, which could have been made by Mr. Stiles.
 There is no evidence that 
 was at the scene of the shooting.
 Monica's actions in the workshop may be suspicious, but she claimed that she thought of a new twist on the household wiring during the film, and she seems to be enough of a tinkerer to make that believable.

Text of a letter from Police Chief Klutz dated 
:

Dear Detective:

    


Post script: A few months later, after you are transferred to another department, you get a memo from your former boss. It says that new evidence was discovered in the Linder case, causing the court to reverse Stiles's conviction and set him free. Let's hope he doesn't come around bent on revenge!


The case has come to an end. Would you like to start your investigation over from scratch?

You have reached a complete solution to the story. If you like, you may see the author's summary of the case. Of course, you should come up with your own first! Would you like to see the author's summary?

Freeman Linder discovered about a year ago that his wife had taken a lover, Ralph Stiles. This discovery made their marriage deteriorate, with growing bitterness and belligerence, until Mrs. Linder recently took her own life with a gun. Linder planned to take revenge on Stiles by framing him for attempted murder. He enlisted the help of his butler, Phong, and his daughter, Monica.

Linder simultaneously sent two messages, a telegram to you and a phone call to Stiles. He wanted you to come to the house, witness the alleged crime, and then arrest Stiles. In the phone call he told Stiles to come discreetly to the office door at 9:00 to get some pay-off money.

Linder planned an elaborate set-up inside the office. A gun was put in the clock, aiming through the keyhole toward him, who would be sitting behind his desk on the opposite side of the room. Using the butler's button, he would trigger both the gun and the detonation of some explosive attached to the window, thus simulating a shot fired through the window at him.

Monica bought two identical small handguns for this plan. She hid one in the clock, and Phong planted the other, which was fired in secret beforehand, in the back yard just before 9:00, where you could find it later.

When Stiles's car appeared, Phong went to the front door, rang the door bell as a signal to Linder, and sneaked into the house. Linder kept an eye on the window and, when Stiles appeared, pushed the button to fire the shot. Stiles panicked and fled out the back of the yard but was brought back inside by Sgt. Duffy.

The plot thickened, however, because Monica decided to take this opportunity to murder her father. Her mother and she were very close. Mr. Linder was often away on business during Monica's childhood, and Mrs. Linder imbued her daughter with a love/hatred for him, saying that he abandoned them. Monica helped her father construct the remote-controlled gun, but she also blamed him for her mother's death and had lost all love for him. She therefore aimed the gun to kill her father when fired. Her idea was to convict Stiles of the murder and go free herself.

Phong had no idea of Monica's plan until he saw Linder's corpse. He did not spill the beans on Linder's plan, since he also had reason to want Linder removed from the scene. Monica, as a last resort, may have attempted to convince you that her father was dying of a stomach tumor and had planned his own death. But Monica is the only one who could have twisted Linder's plan into murder: the key to the clock was hidden on her person, so she had final control of the gun's aim.


A few days pass, and you don't hear from Linder. But a small item in the newspaper catches your eye: a grifter named Stiles was found dead on the beach one morning, with a cheap handgun lying near and a single small bullet wound through his heart. Does this death have anything to do with Linder and your visit? Well, no need to lose sleep over it. Everyone sleeps the big sleep sooner or later.
