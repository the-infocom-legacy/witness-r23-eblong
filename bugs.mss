First release in production was thirteen (13), serial number 830524.

These bugs are fixed in release eighteen (18), serial number 830910:

@begin (itemize)

You can GET IN or CLIMB IN anything and get trapped there!
(For fun, try getting in the clock, the cat, other characters, etc.)

GO THRU OFFICE DOOR will let you leave the office before the gunshot!
This violates an important assumption and thus voids your warrantee.

You can't pick up the handcuffs! (Moral: don't ever put them down.)

If you arrest a non-person without specifying FOR what, the response
"What a detective! ..." contains garbage.

ASK MONICA ABOUT CANCER responds "Dad gave it to me ..."!

ASK DUFFY ABOUT CORONER responds "They'll be here ..." even after they've
been here.

Even if the door is closed,
you can go between the living and dining rooms, and from the tub room to the
bathroom.

You can SEARCH (another room) FOR (anything) from a distance.

You can handcuff Monica with any tool (e.g. keys), not just the handcuffs.

If you don't go in the house, but you wait on the office path until
Stiles is on the office porch, then call his name and go to the porch,
he's described as though the shot had been fired.

If you don't go in the house,
Stiles gives the wrong response to WHO AM I and WHERE IS (anything).

Even if you're sitting down or hiding, you can still use some verbs on objects
in the room that should be out of your reach.
(Verbs: drink, eat, enter, handcuff, kick, kill, kiss, phone, put, put under,
raise, read, slap, smell, take outside, walk around, walk to, and their
synonyms.)

Some commands that include the name of the room you're in will respond
"(You can't see any ... here!)"

Even if Monica is handcuffed, she will play another record in her
bedroom, and she will push you away if you try to TAKE HER OUTSIDE
or take her shoes or feel her.

TAKE KEY FROM MONICA may respond "He doesn't have it."

In rock garden, PUT (anything) ON ROCKS responds "There's no room."

Comparing the muddy and hidden guns doesn't tell you that one barrel is short.

If you're not in the office when Monica tests the button, you don't
hear any bell and Phong doesn't go to the office.

If you're not in the office when Phong shows up after Monica tests the
button, and then @i(you) push a button anywhere, Monica gives her "I was just
testing" speech when Phong arrives where you are.

If you don't push the button before Monica fixes it, and you ask Duffy
for a hint, he will not get to the hints in his list that follow the
one about the button.

When Phong first lets you in, ASK FOR LINDER responds "Mr@. Phong isn't
here!" instead of "Mr@. Linder isn't here!"

If you're in the driveway when Monica goes through the garage,
she's described as being "down the hall to the east" instead of
"off to the east".

You can (try to) break, rub, kick, push, raise, or revive the cat
(or other "global objects")
even when you're not in the office.

The moon lights up the yard even after sunrise.

LOOK DOWN claims the ground is muddy, even if you're on the driveway, porch,
etc.
@end (itemize)

These bugs are fixed in release twenty (20), serial number 831119:

@begin (itemize)

You can talk to people even if you're hiding.

You can examine things in the room even if you're hiding. The program
should allow it but warn you that you can't do a very good job of it.

You can get the putty and wire in the office by trying to eat them,
even before the gunshot.

If you're in the hallway when Duffy and Stiles reach the living room,
Duffy seems to disappear without notice.

Characters claim no knowledge of "the gunshot" and "Mrs Linder's suicide".

The English parser doesn't like "supply of wire" (in workshop)
or "row of shoes" (in entry). They should be "other wire" and "other shoes"
respectively.

The abbreviation "z" for "wait" is missing.

In the kitchen, "Take range and mixer" gives NO response. Ditto in the
workshop for "Take hose and rake" and "Take blue wire and red wire" etc.
(The range and the mixer are really the same object! So are the tools and
the "other wire".)

If you try to look through a window and there isn't one where you are,
the response refers to the car window.

There is a blank line before each prompt, even in SUPERBRIEF mode.

The verb (or command) "what's" is spelled without apostrophes.

Some objectionable words ("bastard", "God", etc.) appear in the Tandy version.

If the only wires in the room are the standard white and black ones,
you can (for example) examine them, but trying to (for example) take
them gets you "(You can't see the wire here.)".

If you're in Monica's room when she enters, TIE HER TO BED responds
"Monica isn't here!"

You can't read Monica's books; it should say that one important book
is missing.

If you try to handcuff Monica where there's nothing to fasten her to
(but after she's gotten the hidden gun), she ends up half-cuffed.

Linder can sit in his carved chair and push the butler's button,
but you can't do the same thing after Monica fixes it.
@end (itemize)

These bugs are fixed in release twenty-one (21), serial number 831208:

@begin (itemize)
If you, for example, "ask Phong about Monica" when neither is present,
the response is "Monica isn't here!" instead of "Phong isn't here!"

The program occasionally will display garbage instead of a person's name
if you refer to someone who isn't there.

If you examine a window while outdoors, white wires are described but
you can't refer to them.
@end (itemize)
